A palindrome is a number that reads the same left to right as it does form right to left, such as 131. How many six-digit palindromes are there which are even?
- 400
- 360
- 512
- 432
Answer : 400
Justification :
- Palindrome 6 digit even number can be formed by using only three digits
- Unit digits can be filled by using 2,4,6,8 digits only
- Number of ways = 4C1 = 4 ways
- Remaining 2 places can be filled by any one of the digits = 10C1 x 10C1 = 100
- Total = 400 ways

Question No: 4
In how many ways can 4 Indians and 4 Nepalese people be seated around a round table such that no two Indians are in adjacent positions?
- 524
- 324
- 144
- 120
Answer : 120
Justification :
- We want to determine the number of ways in which 4 Indians and 4 Nepalese people can be seated around a round table so that no two Indians are in adjacent positions.
- Let the 4 Indians sit around the table first. Place four chairs around the table for this purpose.
- Since the positions around the table are not numbered, it does not matter on which chair the first person sits. 
- The second person then has a choice of 3 chairs, the third person has a choice of 2 chairs and the fourth person sits on the remaining chair.
- Hence the number of ways the 4 Indians can sit around the table is 3!.
- Since no two Indians are to be in adjacent positions, the 4 Nepalese have to sit in such a way that there is at least one Nepalese between two Indians. 
- Since there are only 4 Nepalese and exactly 4 places to be filled between the four Indians, the number of ways in which the Nepalese can be seated is 4!.
- Hence the total number of ways in which 4 Indians and 4 Nepalese people can be seated around a round table so that no two Indians are in adjacent positions is 3!×4!=6×24=144.

Question No: 5
In how many different ways can 8 examination papers be arranged in a row, so that the best and the worst papers may never come together?
- 10080
- 40520
- 40320
- 30240
Answer : 30240
Justification :
- Total number of arrangements when best and worst papers are together = 7! X 2! = 10080
- Total number of way in which the 8 papers can be arranged = 8! = 40320
- Therefore, the number of arrangements in which best and worst papers are not together 
                      = 40320 – 10080 = 30240

Question No: 6
Given 3 different red dyes, 4 different blue dyes, and 5 different green dyes, how many combinations of dyes can be made taking at least one green and one blue dye?
- 4270
- 3890
- 3500
- 3720
Answer : 3720 
Justification :
Solution 1 :
- At least 1 green dye can be selected out of 5 green dyes in (25 – 1) i.e. 31 ways. 
- Similarly, at least one blue dye can be selected out of 4 in (24 - 1) i.e. 
- 15 ways and at least 1 red or no red dye can be selected out of 3 red dyes in 23 i.e. 8 ways. 
- Hence the required number of ways = 31 x 15 x 8 = 3720. 
Solution 2 :
Green dyes =5
Blue dyes =4
Red dyes =3
The no of ways of choosing of at least one green and one blue is =(25−1)×(24−1)×23⇒(32−1)×(16−1)×8⇒31×15×8⇒3720

Question No: 7

- Similarly, 3 books on Chemistry and 4 books on Biology can be arranged in 3! and 4! ways respectively. 
- Besides it the three sets of physics, Chemistry and Biology also can be arranged in 3! ways. 
- Three shelf's can be arranged in 3! ways 
- Required number of permutations = 3! X 6! X 3! X 4! = 622080. 

Question No: 8
How many four digit numbers greater than 5000 can be formed with the digits, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 no digit being repeated?
- 72
- 64
- 124
- 216
- 148
Answer : 72 
Justification :
- To form a number greater than 5000, the thousands place must be filled with 5 (or) 6 (or) 7. = 3 ways.
- After filling the thousands place we are left with 4 numbers(because repetition is not allowed) = 4 ways.
- After filling the hundreds place we are left with 3 numbers for 10's place = 3 ways.
- After filling the 10 place with 3 numbers we are left with 2 numbers = 2 ways.
- Total Numbers formed = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                   = 72 ways.

Question No: 9
In how many ways can the 7 letters M, N, O, P, Q, R, S be arranged so that P and Q occupy continuous positions?
- 1240
- 1400
- 1340
- 1440
Answer : 1440
Justification :
Solution 1 :
- (PQ)MNORS
- 6!*2!
- Since PQ always together 1440
Solution 2:
- The sequence PQ can occupy 6 different positions . 
- The remaining characters can occupy 5! positions
- So, for the sequence PQ there are 6× 5! = 6! arrangements
- Now, similarly ,
- For the sequence QP can occupy 6 different positions . The remaining characters can occupy 5! positions
- Therefore , there are again 6! arrangements
- So , The total number of arrangements is 2 × 6! = 1440

If B is in between A and C, in how many ways can one go from B to C? 
- 52
- 44
- 64
- 24
Answer : 64
- There are 8 indirect roads from B to C and 1 direct road
  i.e…, highway from B to C. Also, one can go from B to A and then to C.
- There are 10 + 1 indirect and direct roads from B to A and then 5 roads from A to C.
- This can be done in 11 x 5 = 55 ways.  
- In all one can go 55 + 8 + 1 = 64 ways.

Question No: 13
In how many ways 5 Indians and 4 Americans be seated around the table, if both sit together?
- 8!-(5! * 4!)
- 1080
- 9!
- 4! X 5!
Answer : 4! x 5!
Justification :
- Since there is no restriction on Indians, we arrange the 5 Indians around a table in (5 – 1)! = 4!, Ways. 
- If the American sit at the places indicated by ‘x’ then no two American will sit together.
- Now there are 5 places for 4 Americans.4 Americans can be seated in 5P4 ways. 
- Required number = 4! X 5P4 = 4! X 5!

- This is possible in 19C3 + (18C2 x 19C1) = 3876. 

Question No: 17
In how many ways three different rings can be worn in four fingers with at most one in each finger?
- 32
- 24
- 12
- 8
Answer : 12
Justification :
Solution 1 :
- Since we cannot wear more than one ring in any finger means repetition is not allowed. 
- Hence, the first ring can be worn in any of the available 4 fingers in 4 ways and second ring can be worn in any of the remaining 3 fingers in 3 ways and third ring can be worn in any of the remaining 2 fingers in 2 ways. 
- So the required number of ways in which all the 3 rings can be worn in 4 fingers = 4 x 3 x 2 = 24. 
Solution 2:
- F1 F2 F3 F4
- R1 4 choices
- R2 3 choice
- R3 2 choices 4*3*2=24

Question No: 19
A gentleman has 6 friends to invite for a party. In how many ways can he send invitation cards to them if he has three servants to carry the cards?
- 343
- 216
- 729
- 512
Answer : 512
Justification :
Solution 1:
- Total number of ways = 3⁶ = 729.
Solution 2:
- For one friend he has 3 servants to send the card.
- This implies that,
  For one person, he can send it by 3 ways.
- So for 6 persons he can send it by : 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 3⁶ ways
- So he can send the invitation by 729 ways.

Question No: 20
How many odd integers from 1000 to 8000 (inclusive) have distinct digits?
- 1344
- 56
- 1736
- 392
Answer : 1736
Justification :
-For a number to be odd the unit digit should be either 1 ,3 , 5 , 7 , 9
- Thousands place cannot be filled with 8 or 9
- For units digit when it is filled with 9 the thousands place can be filled in 7 ways namely any digit from 1 to 7 and the remaining two places can be filled in 8 ×7 =56 ways
- So, the total number formed in this way 56×7= 392
- Now if units place is filled with any of the four digits 1,3,5 or 7 , the thousands place can be filled in 6 ways( zero will be excluded) and the remaining two places can be filled in 8 × 7 = 56
- So, the total number formed in this way 56×6×4= 1344
- Hence, total numbers are 392+1344 =1736
